The analysis presented in the repository is related to the content of a master's thesis on “Meta-analysis and characterization of biological functions of the gut microbiome in psychiatric disorders using deep learning methods.” It contains an analysis of data on the gut microbiome and its impact in cases of depression.

# Abstract 
Depression remains a complex and still insuffi ciently understood disorder, and its potential correlation with the gut microbiome continues to raise many questions. Establishing such a link could make it possible to limit harmful bacterial functions and activities, and consequently contribute to mitigating the symptoms of the disease. The main objective of this study is to show the links between the psychological field and biological processes and to assess the possibility of analyzing multiple datasets that differ in structure and method of information extraction. This approach may in the future improve the process of formulating more generalized and reliable research conclusions.

The study focuses on two independent datasets, which were analyzed in terms of both metadata and metabolic pathways. This approach distinguishes this work from previous
publications in this area. The pathways were examined using alpha and beta diversity metrics. The two datasets were then combined into one, on which the analyses were repeated
and the results compared. This work is a preliminary stage of broader research and should be treated as one of the sources for expanding knowledge about the relationship between the gut microbiome and mental health. It also points to the potential of integrative multi-dataset analyses in the context of deepening the understanding of depression and its biological determinants.
